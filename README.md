# Bit-Manipulation-Library
Some bit operations to optimize algorithms. 

Here you find the following functionalities:

  Represent a long bool unidimensional array using bits (this is useful to save memory)

  Know if one number is power of two
  
  Convert a decimal number to binary string
  
  Extract one bit from a number (for example 1110111 at 3rd index(0th based) -> 111111)
